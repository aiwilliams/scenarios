== Scenarios

In a nutshell, scenarios are a drop in replacement for YAML fixtures. Instead of encouraging you to create a mindless amount raw data in the form of YAML, scenarios encourage you to create code that populates your tables with the appropriate data.

=== Usage

Scenarios should be placed in the spec/scenarios directory of your Rails project. Scenario file names should always end in "_scenario.rb" and classes should always end in "Scenario".

A simple scenario looks like this

  class PersonScenario < Scenario::Base
  
    def load
      create_record(
        :person,
        :name => 'Long John',
        :username => 'longjohn',
        :password => 'password'
      )
    end
  
  end

The simplest scenario only needs to implement one method: the <tt>load</tt> method. Inside the load method you can insert records using the Scenario::Base#create_record instance method. The first parameter is the name of the table to insert the record into and the second parameter is for attributes.

To use this scenario in a spec you would do:

  describe Person do
    scenario :person
  
    ... examples here ...
  
  end

You can find additional examples in spec/scenarios_spec.rb.
